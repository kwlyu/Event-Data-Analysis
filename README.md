# How to use this repository

## R/RStudio and Maize

This shiny app is built with R. Carleton provides two servers ([maize](https://maize.mathcs.carleton.edu/)) for students to access Posit Workbench remotely. If you don't already have a machine that runs [RStudio](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/) locally, you can use the Maize servers to clone and update this repository. Visit the [Carleton Math and Stats Department](https://www.carleton.edu/math/resources/statistics-and-r-studio-help/) website for more help. **Note that this shiny app is memory intensive (it frequently requires over 1 GB of memory), so a local machine is recommended.**
